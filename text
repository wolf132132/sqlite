SQL JOINT clause to join the table together.
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

SELECT artists.name, albums.name FROM albums INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id ORDER BY artists.name;

SELECT * FROM artist_list WHERE name LIKE "jefferson%"

SELECT artists.name, albums.name, songs.track, songs.title from
    INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
    INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artists = artists._id
    ORDER BY artists.name, albums.name, songs.track

#This is wild card. find any albums with "doctor"
SELECT artists.name, albums.name, songs.track, songs.title from
    INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
    INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artists = artists._id
    WHERE albums.name LIKE "%doctor%"
    ORDER BY artists.name, albums.name, songs.track

SQL CREATE VIEW Statement
In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

CREATE VIEW album_list AS
SELECT name FROM albums
ORDER BY name

The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

SELECT count(DISTINCT artist) FROM artist_list WHERE artist_list WHERE artist = "Aerosmith"

Challenge:
1. select the titles of all the songs on the albums "forbidden"
SELECT songs.title FROM songs INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id WHERE albums.name = "Forbidden"
